This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_56/) aims to develop a web application to enable the accessible and efficient use of an image classification model for directly learning hierarchical features from raw pixel data of brain magnetic resonance images. The model development process leveraged the Convolutional Neural Network to extract low- and high-level features for differentiating between image categories. Various hyperparameters, including the number of convolutional layers, filter size, and number of dense layer weights, were systematically evaluated to optimize the CNN model architecture. Image Augmentation techniques were employed to increase the diversity of training images and improve the model's ability to generalize. To enhance model performance and robustness, various regularization techniques were explored, including Dropout, Batch Normalization, and their Combinations. These methods helped mitigate overfitting and ensured stable learning. Callback functions such as Early Stopping, Learning Rate Reduction on Performance Plateaus, and Model Checkpointing were implemented to fine-tune the training process, optimize convergence, and prevent overtraining. Model evaluation was conducted using Precision, Recall, and F1 Score metrics to ensure both false positives and false negatives are considered, providing a more balanced view of model classification performance. Post-training, interpretability was emphasized through an advanced visualization technique using Gradient Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), providing insights into the spatial and hierarchical features that influenced the model's predictions, offering a deeper understanding of the decision-making process. Creating the prototype required cloning the repository containing two application codes and uploading to Streamlit Community Cloud - a Model Prediction Code to randomly sample an image; estimate image class probabilities; and predict class categories, and a User Interface Code to preprocess the sampled image as a test case; display the RGB and Grad-CAM visualization plots; execute all computations, estimations and predictions; and compare the class prediction with the ground truth. The final image classification model was deployed as a [Streamlit Web Application](https://brain-mri-image-classification.streamlit.app/).
